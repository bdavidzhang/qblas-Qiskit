A open source quantum basic linear algebra and quantum simulation library.

Developed with Q#.

Q# is a new high-level quantum-focused programming language developed by Microsoft. Ref https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/language/?view=qsharp-preview.

Quantum exponential acceleration algorithms will greatly accelerate various computational and machine learning tasks.
The library help you run quantum basic linear algebra and quantum simulation algorithms on a quntum computer.

The basic linear algebra contains vector inner product, HHL matrix eigenvalue decomposition, fourier transform, Quantum phase estimation and other algorithms.
The quantum simulation contains sparse matrix quantum walk simulation, density matrix exponentiation simulation and Trotter decomposition simulation.
